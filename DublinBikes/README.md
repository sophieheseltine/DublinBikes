# Dublin Bikes

This is a project to display bike availability for Dublin Bikes, a city bikes scheme, across the city of Dublin. It will display current availability of bikes and bike stands on a map and will also display predicted bike availability for a chosen station. The website shows the current weather as well as weather forecast for the next 24 hours and will also show the predicted availability of bikes depending on whether or not it is raining.

## Installing

Clone the repository using 

    git clone https://github.com/rosannahanly/Group8Project.git

Navigate into Group8Project/dublin_bikes
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Then
    
    python serve.py
    
Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/] or [localhost:5000]


## Prerequisites

This is built to be used with Python 3. Update `Makefile` to switch to Python 2 if needed.

Some Flask dependencies are compiled during installation, so `gcc` and Python header files need to be present.
For example, on Ubuntu:

    apt install build-essential python3-dev


## Development environment and release process

 - create virtualenv with Flask and Dublin Bikes installed into it (latter is installed in
   [develop mode](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#development-mode) which allows
   modifying source code directly without a need to re-install the app): `make venv`

 - run development server in debug mode: `make run`; Flask will restart if source code is modified

 - run tests: `make test` (see also: [Testing Flask Applications](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/testing/))

 - create source distribution: `make sdist` (will run tests first)

 - to remove virtualenv and built distributions: `make clean`

 - to add more python dependencies: add to `install_requires` in `setup.py`

 - to modify configuration in development environment: edit file `settings.cfg`; this is a local configuration file
   and it is *ignored* by Git - make sure to put a proper configuration file to a production environment when
   deploying


## Deployment

If you are interested in an out-of-the-box deployment automation, check out accompanying
[`cookiecutter-flask-ansible`](https://github.com/candidtim/cookiecutter-flask-ansible).

Or, check out [Deploying with Fabric](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/fabric/#fabric-deployment) on one of the
possible ways to automate the deployment.

In either case, generally the idea is to build a package (`make sdist`), deliver it to a server (`scp ...`),
install it (`pip install dublin_bikes.tar.gz`), ensure that configuration file exists and
`DUBLIN_BIKES_SETTINGS` environment variable points to it, ensure that user has access to the
working directory to create and write log files in it, and finally run a
[WSGI container](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/wsgi-standalone/) with the application.
And, most likely, it will also run behind a
[reverse proxy](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/deploying/wsgi-standalone/#proxy-setups).
